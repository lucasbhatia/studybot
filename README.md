## How It Works

### Content Extraction
1. When you click "Extract," the content script analyzes the current webpage
2. It identifies main content (avoiding sidebars, ads, navigation)
3. Text is extracted and sent to the background service worker

### AI Generation (Template-Based)
The `ai-generator.js` uses rule-based NLP to:
- Parse text into sentences and paragraphs
- Identify definition patterns ("X is...", "X refers to...")
- Extract key concepts and terms
- Generate multiple-choice questions
- Create true/false statements
- Produce summaries at different detail levels

This system is designed to be easily upgraded to use OpenAI/Claude APIs.

### Storage
- All data is stored locally using Chrome's `storage.sync` and `storage.local` APIs
- Settings sync across your Chrome profile
- Study sets are stored locally for fast access
- No backend required for MVP

### Sharing
- Share links are generated by encoding study sets in base64
- Classmates can import JSON files directly
- For production, this could connect to a backend API

## Technical Stack

- **Manifest V3** - Latest Chrome extension standard
- **Chrome APIs** - Storage, Side Panel, Scripting, Context Menus
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No external dependencies
- **CSS3** - Animations, flexbox, responsive design

## Development Notes

### Adding AI API Integration

To upgrade from template-based generation to Claude/OpenAI:

1. Update `ai-generator.js` to call the API
2. Add API key management to settings
3. Update manifest with necessary permissions
4. Implement error handling for API failures
5. Cache responses to minimize API calls

Example:
```javascript
async generateWithAI(text) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': this.apiKey,
      'content-type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'claude-opus',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: `Summarize: ${text}` }],
    }),
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

### Debugging

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find StudyBot and click "Details"
3. Click "Inspect views: service worker" for background logs
4. Right-click the extension icon → "Inspect popup" for popup logs
5. Right-click on any webpage → "Inspect" and search for console logs from content scripts

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing
- Verify you're in Developer Mode on `chrome://extensions/`

### Content Not Extracting
- Some websites may block content scripts (check CSP)
- Try right-clicking and selecting "Generate study materials"
- Works best on text-heavy pages (articles, docs)

### Cards Not Showing
- Make sure content was extracted successfully
- Check that the Study Library shows the set was saved
- Try opening the set again from the popup

### Storage Issues
- Clear extension data: Settings → Privacy and security → Clear browsing data
- Try exporting and re-importing your study sets
- Check available disk space
